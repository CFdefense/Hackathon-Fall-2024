# TypeDash

## Installation
1. `npm install` 
2. `npm run dev`
3. Go to localhost in browser!

## How to Play  
1. You can type the word in the box (case insensitive) for the column you wish to move to.
2. You can only move one hop at a time (ex. left to middle, to go left to right you must pass through the middle first).
3. Dodge the obstacles! In this case, we want to avoid the left column.
